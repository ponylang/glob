## Update ponylang/regex dependency to 1.1.0

This change is a small convenience for Windows users and otherwise provides no change in functionality.

ponylang/regex brings no functionality changes, however, it makes the build process slightly for the dependency easier for Windows users. Note, ponylang/regex still has a dependency on a 3rd party library that still has to be built by hand.
